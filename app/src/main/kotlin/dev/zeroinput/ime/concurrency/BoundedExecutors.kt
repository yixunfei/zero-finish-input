/**
 * Creates the small, bounded workers used by the application layer.
 *
 * An IME can receive lifecycle callbacks faster than encrypted storage or
 * native initialization can finish.  An unbounded executor would retain every
 * cancelled callback in that situation and turn a short burst into a long
 * tail of stale work.  Rejection is intentional: callers keep the result in
 * memory and can retry on the next lifecycle boundary instead of blocking the
 * input thread.
